## Task 1

### Step 1.1

- Preliminarly, verify the form of the density function $\rho(r)$ by inferring it form the particle distribution and compare it with the analytical density function described in the original paper by Hernquist (1990). Use Poissonion error bars when comparing the numerical density  profile with the analytical expected values
